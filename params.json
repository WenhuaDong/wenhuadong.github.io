It can help citizens in taking decisions whereabouts which depends on the quality of environment of the place.\r\n\r\n# Tools and Technology Selection\r\n\r\nThis system can be divided into two different subsystems - \r\n\r\n1. A web application for showing visualizations from collected data and allowing user to share the environmental information (version one).\r\n\r\n2. An android application for supporting those advance features which are limited by the browsers. For example, Augmented Reality (for the future versions).\r\n\r\n## Requirements for Web Application for PESQoL\r\nThis web application is a [client server application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-server_architecture), in which client is a browser and server is a software written in Java.\r\n\r\n### Client\r\nClient application will have the responsibility of providing user a way to send environmental and personal information to the server. It also present environmental information in a comprehensible way using Charts, Graphs and Maps to user. \r\n\r\n**Tools and Technology** -\r\n\r\n1. HTML - for designing web pages\r\n\r\n2. CSS - For styling web pages\r\n\r\n3. JavaScript - for manipulating web pages and making them interactive\r\n\r\n4. jQuery - A JavaScript based library to take care of cross browser compatibility\r\n\r\n5. d3.js - D3.js is a JavaScript library for creating graphs, charts and maps.\r\n\r\n6. Weather Underground APIs - This service, provide by the http://www.wunderground.com/, can be used to get the weather information about a place\r\n\r\n7. Google Maps API - Google Maps API can be used to visualize environmental data on maps, and can also be used to find a place using GPS.\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
